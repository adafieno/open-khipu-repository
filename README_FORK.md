# Khipu Decipherment Research Project

**A computational research fork of the [Open Khipu Repository](https://github.com/khipulab/open-khipu-repository)**

## About This Fork

This repository is a research fork focused on **computational hypothesis-testing tools for khipu analysis**. It builds upon the excellent foundational work of the Open Khipu Repository (OKR) to develop rigorous, falsifiable methods for testing interpretive models of Inka khipus.

**This is not a "decipherment" project.** Rather, it provides computational infrastructure to help scholars test hypotheses transparently, quantify uncertainty, and surface structural patterns that may inform future interpretive work.

### Research Goals

1. **Arithmetic validation framework** - Test summation consistency and internal numeric logic (following Medrano & Khosla 2024)
2. **Graph-based structural analysis** - Convert khipus into hierarchical graphs to identify recurring patterns
3. **Hypothesis parameterization** - Represent multiple interpretations explicitly (e.g., color semantics as configurable assumptions)
4. **Pattern discovery with constraints** - Use unsupervised learning while requiring patterns across multiple provenances
5. **Multi-modal feature extraction** - Integrate numeric, color, spatial, and structural data with uncertainty tracking
6. **Expert-in-the-loop validation** - Build checkpoints for domain expert review at each analytical stage

### Project Status

- ✅ **Phase 0: Reconnaissance** - Database analysis and data model documentation (COMPLETE)
- ⏳ **Phase 1: Infrastructure** - Data extraction pipelines with validation hooks (IN PROGRESS)
- 📋 **Phase 2: Arithmetic Validation** - Test known summation rules, establish ground truth baseline
- 📋 **Phase 3: Pattern Discovery** - Clustering and motif mining with provenance-aware constraints
- 📋 **Phase 4: Hypothesis Testing** - Multi-model evaluation framework with uncertainty quantification

## Original Open Khipu Repository

This research project is built entirely upon the [Open Khipu Repository](https://github.com/khipulab/open-khipu-repository), maintained by:

- **Advisory Board:** Carrie Brezine, Jon Clindaniel, Iván Ghezzi, Sabine Hyland, Manuel Medrano
- **Administration:** Open Khipu Research Laboratory (Jon Clindaniel, jclindaniel@uchicago.edu)
- **Contributors:** Robert and Marcia Ascher, Carrie Brezine, Jon Clindaniel, Hugo Pereyra, Kylie Quave, Gary Urton

### About Khipus

Inka khipus were unique pre-Columbian Andean recording devices using three-dimensional signs—knots, cords, and colors—as symbols functionally similar to early writing systems. Spanish chronicles and contemporary studies indicate khipus recorded everything from accounting to historical narratives.

**Status:** The numeric encoding system is well-understood (decimal positional notation established by Locke 1912, refined by Ascher & Ascher). Recent work (Medrano & Khosla 2024) found ~74% of khipus contain internally consistent arithmetic summations. However, semantic meaning beyond accounting remains debated, with no consensus on whether khipus encoded narrative, categorical, or linguistic information.

### Prior Computational Work

This project builds on:
- **Medrano & Khosla (2024):** Algorithmic analysis of 650 khipus, arithmetic consistency testing, white cord boundary detection
- **Clindaniel (2024):** Transformer-based clustering of cord attributes, latent categorical structure discovery
- **Ascher & Ascher:** Foundational comparative datasets and arithmetic structure documentation

Our contribution focuses on **validation infrastructure** and **hypothesis testing frameworks** rather than new interpretive claims.

### Data Source

The OKR contains:
- **619 extant khipus** from archaeological sites and museums worldwide
- **54,403 cords** with hierarchical structure and physical attributes
- **110,677 knots** with type, position, and numeric encoding
- **56,306 color records** with detailed multi-color specifications
- Geographic provenance from 53 archaeological sites

## Research Methodology

See [docs/methodology/](docs/methodology/) for detailed documentation of:
- Database structure and semantics
- Data quality assessments and uncertainty quantification
- Validation strategies and expert-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Hypothesis parameterization and multi-interpretation support
- Overfitting prevention (provenance-aware splitting, cross-validation, perturbation testing)
- Analysis approaches with falsifiable claims
- Findings with confidence intervals and limitations

**Key Principle:** AI surfaces structure and quantifies uncertainty; domain experts provide interpretation and validation.

**Note:** This is a research fork for computational analysis. It does not modify or challenge the original OKR data. This project builds **tools for hypothesis testing**, not semantic decipherment. We surface patterns, test falsifiable claims, and quantify uncertainty—interpretation remains the domain of archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians. All findings will be published through appropriate academic channels with full acknowledgment of the OKR's foundational role and prior computational work.
