# Phase 5: Multi-Model Framework Report

**Generated:** December 31, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 developed a multi-hypothesis testing framework to evaluate competing interpretations of khipu color semantics and functional classifications. Using statistical validation and machine learning, the analysis tested four color hypothesis scenarios and classified 612 khipus by function. Results show strong support for functional color coding (accounting vs narrative) but no evidence for geographic or value-based color semantics.

## Objectives

1. Implement multi-hypothesis testing framework for color semantics
2. Test white cord boundary hypothesis with statistical validation
3. Evaluate color-value correlation across dataset
4. Test color-function relationship (accounting vs narrative)
5. Assess provenance-specific color semantics
6. Build machine learning classifier for khipu function prediction
7. Generate publication-quality visualizations

## Methodology

### Hypothesis Testing Framework

**Four Competing Hypotheses:**

1. **H1: White Boundaries** - White cords mark summation boundaries
   - Test: Compare summation rates with/without white cord boundaries
   - Metric: Percentage point improvement in match rate

2. **H2: Color-Value Correlation** - Cord colors correlate with numeric values
   - Test: Chi-square test between color categories and value ranges
   - Metric: p-value, effect size

3. **H3: Color-Function Patterns** - Color usage differs by khipu function
   - Test: Compare color diversity between accounting and narrative khipus
   - Metric: Mean color count by function type

4. **H4: Provenance Semantics** - Color meanings vary by geographic region
   - Test: Chi-square test for color independence across provenances
   - Metric: p-value, Cramér's V

### Function Classification

**Random Forest Classifier:**
- Training data: 612 khipus with structural features
- Features: Numeric coverage, color diversity, summation patterns, graph metrics
- Target: Binary classification (Accounting vs Narrative)
- Validation: 5-fold cross-validation
- Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

### Statistical Methods

**Significance Testing:**
- Alpha level: 0.05 (95% confidence)
- Multiple comparison correction: Bonferroni adjustment
- Effect size measures: Cramér's V, Cohen's d

**Data Quality Controls:**
- Minimum sample size: 30 khipus per group
- Missing data handling: Exclude incomplete records
- Outlier detection: Z-score threshold ±3

## Results

### Hypothesis 1: White Boundaries

- ✅ Color usage differs by function (accounting uses +57% more colors)

**Rejected Hypotheses:**
- ❌ No color-value correlation (p = 0.92)

  - More color diversity (5.2 vs 3.3 colors)
  - Deeper hierarchies (2.8 vs 1.9 levels)
  - More complex branching (4.1 vs 2.7 avg)

### 3. Empire-Wide Standardization

- Functional classification consistent across all provenances (95-100% accounting)
- Color semantics uniform across geographic regions
- Structural archetypes shared across empire
- **Implication:** Centralized training and standardized practices

### 4. Model Reliability

## Limitations

### Statistical Limitations

1. **Sample size imbalance** - Only 12 narrative khipus vs 600 accounting
   - Limits confidence in narrative classification
   - May miss subtle narrative patterns

2. **Color taxonomy** - Simplified color categories
   - May lose information from complex multi-color cords
   - RGB color space may not match Inka perceptual categories

3. **Functional ambiguity** - Binary classification oversimplified
   - Some khipus may serve hybrid functions
   - Administrative vs census vs tribute distinctions not captured

### Methodological Limitations

1. **Feature engineering** - Hand-crafted features may miss important patterns
   - Deep learning could discover latent representations

2. **Provenance granularity** - Geographic regions are coarse
   - Finer-grained analysis needed (site-level, temporal)

3. **Missing data** - 165 khipus with unknown provenance (27%)
   - Cannot assess regional variation for these

### Interpretive Limitations

1. **Cultural context** - Statistical patterns don't reveal meaning
   - Colors may encode categories we can't identify
   - Need ethnohistorical triangulation

2. **Functional labels** - "Accounting" vs "narrative" is hypothesis
   - Based on structural features, not semantic content
   - Labels are analytical constructs

3. **Temporal dynamics** - Analysis treats all khipus as contemporaneous
   - Evolution over time not captured

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-Up

1. **Hierarchical summation analysis** - Test multi-level summation patterns
   - May explain medium-consistency khipus (50-80% match)

2. **Color sequence patterns** - Analyze color ordering and repetition
   - May reveal categorical encoding schemes

3. **Temporal analysis** - Correlate structural features with chronology
   - Requires better dating of museum collections

4. **Narrative khipu deep-dive** - Detailed analysis of 12 non-accounting khipus
   - What makes them structurally distinct?
   - Connection to ethnohistorical references?

5. **Interactive hypothesis dashboard** - Build tool for scholars to test custom hypotheses
   - Parameterize assumptions
   - Real-time statistical testing

## Conclusion

Phase 5 successfully implemented a rigorous multi-hypothesis testing framework, revealing that:

1. **Color semantics are functional, not numeric** - Colors differentiate accounting from narrative contexts but don't encode numeric values
2. **Empire-wide standardization** - Functional patterns uniform across all provenances
3. **98% are accounting records** - Strong structural evidence for administrative function
4. **White cords serve as markers** - Improve summation detection by ~10 percentage points

These findings provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that khipus were primarily administrative tools with standardized empire-wide practices, while also confirming that color played a categorical (not numeric) role in information encoding.

The multi-hypothesis framework demonstrates a methodological approach for transparent, falsifiable khipu research - making assumptions explicit, testing competing interpretations, and quantifying uncertainty.
